## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

### Security
- [ ] Change admin password to something very secure
- [ ] Review all environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (already done)
- [ ] Consider enabling 2FA on Vercel/hosting account

### Database
- [ ] Verify Neon database is on a paid plan if you expect high traffic
- [ ] Set up database backups in Neon dashboard
- [ ] Test database connection from production

### Images
- [ ] Verify Cloudinary account limits (free tier: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)
- [ ] Consider upgrading if you'll have many products
- [ ] Optimize images before uploading (recommended: 1000x1000px max)

### Testing
- [ ] Create test admin account
- [ ] Create test customer account
- [ ] Add test products
- [ ] Place test orders
- [ ] Test VIP enrollment
- [ ] Test order approval/discard
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test in different browsers

### Performance
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools
- [ ] Aim for 90+ performance score
- [ ] Check loading times

### Legal
- [ ] Add privacy policy page (if required)
- [ ] Add terms of service (if required)
- [ ] Ensure age verification for tobacco products
- [ ] Add required disclaimers

## Post-Deployment Steps

### 1. Monitor Your Site

Set up monitoring:
- Vercel automatically provides analytics
- Check for errors in Vercel logs
- Monitor Neon database usage

### 2. Regular Maintenance

Weekly:
- [ ] Check for pending orders
- [ ] Review VIP member milestones
- [ ] Add new products

Monthly:
- [ ] Review analytics dashboard
- [ ] Check database storage usage
- [ ] Review Cloudinary usage

### 3. Backups

- Neon provides automatic backups
- Consider exporting important data monthly
- Keep a local backup of product images

## Updating Your Site

To deploy updates:

1. Make changes to your code locally
2. Test thoroughly with `npm run dev`
3. Commit and push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```
4. Vercel will automatically deploy the new version!

## Troubleshooting Production Issues

### Site is slow
- Check Neon database connection
- Optimize images in Cloudinary
- Review Vercel analytics for bottlenecks

### Database connection errors
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check if Neon database is active
- Review connection limits on Neon plan

### Images not loading
- Verify Cloudinary credentials
- Check Cloudinary usage limits
- Ensure image URLs are correct

### Authentication issues
- Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set
- Check NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain
- Clear browser cookies and try again

## Custom Domain Setup

### Using Vercel with Custom Domain

1. Purchase domain from registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. In Vercel:
   - Go to Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - Add your domain (e.g., stopngo.com)
3. Add DNS records at your registrar:
   - Type: A Record
   - Name: @
   - Value: 76.76.21.21
   
   OR
   
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: www
   - Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
5. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` in environment variables

## Performance Optimization Tips

### Images
- Use WebP format when possible
- Compress images before uploading
- Use Cloudinary's automatic optimization features

### Database
- Regularly clean up old/discarded orders
- Index frequently queried fields (already done)
- Monitor query performance in Neon

### Caching
- Vercel automatically caches static assets
- Consider adding ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for product pages if needed

## Scaling Considerations

If your site grows:

1. **Database**: Upgrade Neon plan for more storage and connections
2. **Images**: Upgrade Cloudinary for more bandwidth
3. **Hosting**: Vercel Pro plan for analytics and more
4. **Consider**: Adding Redis for session storage
5. **Consider**: CDN for faster global access (Vercel includes this)
